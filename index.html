    <p id="para"><strong>Dosa</strong> or dosai is one of the most regularly consumed crepes in South India. These are made in so many ways, each differ in proportions of lentils, rice and beaten rice used. While they were made using only rice in the olden days, soon people began to use black gram dal/ urad dal which was widely and easily grown in the dry lands of south India.</p>
    <p>To make most dosa varieties, rice and lentils are soaked for about 4 to 6 hours. Then ground with water to make a thick batter and fermented. This fermentation enhances the nutrition and lends an airy structure to the batter making end product porous and tasty.</p>
    <p>The batter is then spreaded to a thin crepe on a hot seasoned griddle and cooked for short time. Since these are cooked only for short time, typically less than 2 to 3 minutes most nutrients are preserved.
        With the advent of restaurants serving a dosa varieties they became very popular since they tasted addictively delicious.  Various versions like masala dosa, set dosa, benne dosa, neer dosa, egg dosa, chicken dosa, schezwan masala and many such came into existence.
